# MACE models
Effortlessly integrate pre-trained MACE models into your projects with the user-friendly ``mace-models`` package.

```sh
pip install mace-models
```

Loading models is simple with a few lines of code:

```python
import mace_models

# Load a default MACE model
model = mace_models.load()
torch_model = model.get_model()
ase_calculator = model.get_calculator()
# get the model file 
model.get_file()
```

Customize your model selection by loading models from various repositories or specific revisions:

```python
model = mace_models.load(
    "<model-name>",
    rev="<branch-or-sha>",
    remote="https://github.com/<user>/<repo>"
)
```


Ensure a seamless integration by first installing the MACE library and upgrading your PyTorch installation:

```sh
pip install --upgrade torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install git+https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace.git
```

# Models

- `ani500k_small` training data: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017193
- `hydromace` https://github.com/RokasEl/hydromace
- `medium_spice` https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15211
- `small_spice` https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15211

## Example usages with ASE

```python
import mace_models
from ase.build import molecule

model = mace_models.load("medium_spice")

water = molecule("H2O")
water.calc = model.get_calculator(dtype="float64")

print(water.get_potential_energy())
>>> -14.159366
```
